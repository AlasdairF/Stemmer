# Stemmer

This is a fork of the snowball stemmer bindings for Go from [https://bitbucket.org/tebeka/snowball](bitbucket.org/tebeka/snowball) by Miki Tebeka. The fork was made on 2014-07-25, with the last update by Miki on 2013-07-03. I have copied it here so I don't lose it, just in case, since it is very useful for my own Go [https://github.com/AlasdairF/Classifier](Classifier).
